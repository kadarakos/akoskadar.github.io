## Welcome to GitHub Pages

I am a PhD student at [Tilburg Center for Cognition and Communication](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/research/institutes-and-research-groups/ticc/). My project is in the area of Integrating Vision and Language under the supervision of [Afra Alishahi](http://ilk.uvt.nl/~aalishah/) and [Grzegorz Chrupala](http://grzegorz.chrupala.me/). The primary focus of my research is the joint learning of linguistic meaning and visual representations. In my research I use deep learning techniques from Computer Vision and NLP. My main interest at the moment is in improving vision or language processing through joint learning.
